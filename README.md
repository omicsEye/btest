_`btest`_ combines block nonparametric hypothesis testing with false discovery rate correction to 
enable high-sensitivity discovery of linear and non-linear associations in high-dimensional datasets 
(which may be categorical, continuous, or mixed). btest perform test by: 
1) adjust data to covariates, 
2) hierarchically clustering to pair block of significantly associated features, 
3) provide informative association by incorporating within data sets and among data sets relationships, and
4) high quality visualization of data.

#### Installing with pip ####

* $ pip install btest ``
* This command will automatically install btest and its dependencies.
* To overwrite existing installations of dependencies use "-U" to force update them. 
* To use the existing version of dependencies use "--no-dependencies." 
* If you do not have write permissions to '/usr/lib/,' then add the option "--user" to the btest install command. Using this option will install the python package into subdirectories of '~/.local' on Linux. Please note when using the "--user" install option on some platforms, you might need to add '~/.local/bin/' to your $PATH as default might not include it. You will know if it needs to be added if you see the following message `btest: command not found` when trying to run btest after installing with the "--user" option.
* If you use Windows operating system you can install it with administrator permission easily (please open a terminal with administrator permission and the rest is the same).

### 2. Test the installation ###

1. Test out the install with unit and functional tests
     * `` $ btest_test``

### 3. Try out a demo run ###


With btest installed you can try out a demo run using two sample synthetic datasets. 
``$ btest -X demo/X_dataset.txt -Y demo/Y_dataset.txt -o $OUTPUT_DIR --fdr 0.1``

The output from this demo run will be written to the folder $OUTPUT_DIR.

## Installation Update ##

If you have already installed btest, using the [Initial Installation](#initial-installation) steps, and would like to upgrade your installed version to the latest version, please do:

`sudo -H pip install btest --upgrade --no-deps` or
`pip install btest --upgrade --no-deps`

This command upgrades btest to the latest version and ignores updating btest's dependencies. 



## Output files ##

When btest is completed, three main output files will be created:

### 1. Associations file ###

## Configuration ##

btest produces a performance file to store user configuration settings. This configuration file is automatically created in the output directory.

```sh
$ vi btest.log
btest version:	1.1.1

```

## Tutorials ##

### Adjust for covariates ###

btest can be used to test the relationship between metadata (e.g. age and gender) and data (e.g. microbial species abundance and immune cell counts). In this case, related (covaried) metadata cluster together. In circumstances that two datasets are tested such as microbiome vs. metabolites, the effect of covariates (e.g. age, gender, and batch effect)  from both datasets such as (microbial species and metabolites) should be regressed out. Users should adjust for covariates. Here we provide two examples of R programming that how to adjust for a variable.

* **Adjust for age**: let's regress out the age effect from microbial species or metabolites:
 
```
#!python

lmer(microbe ~ age, microbial_abundance_data = table)
lmer(metabolite ~ age, metabolites_data = table)
```

* **Adjust for time**: this type of adjustment with groups structure involving has more complexity for adjusting and we recommend to read Winkler et al. Neuroimage. 2014 entitled *Permutation inference for the general linear model.* A simple code for this case would be: assume we have microbial samples from the same subject in several time-points a linear mixed-effects model is fit using the R lme4 package to each microbial species or metabolites of the form:


```
#!python

lmer(microbe ~ 1 + (1 | subject) + time, microbial_abundance_data = table)
```


### Selecting a desired false discovery rate ###

btest by default use 0.1 as the target false discovery rate. Users can change it to the desired value, for example, 0.05 or 0.25 by using `-q 0.05`.

### Selecting a similarity measurement ###

btestâ€™s implementation and hypothesis testing scheme are highly general, allowing them to be used with a wide variety of similar measures. For similarity measurement option we recommend: 1) Spearman coefficient for continues data, 2)(default for btest) normalized mutual information (NMI) for mixed data (continuous, categorical, and binary data), and 3) discretized maximum information coefficient (DMIC) for complicated associations types such as sine waves in continuous data.  Similarity measures are implemented in the current version of btest that user can use as options are: Spearman coefficient, discretized normalized mutual information, discretized adjusted mutual information, discretized maximal information coefficient, Pearson correlation, distance correlation (dCor).  
``-m spearman`` for example change the default similarity to Spearman coefficient as similarity measurement, and it automatically bypasses discretizing step. For available similarity metrics, please look at btest options using ``btest -h``.

### Selecting a decomposition method ###

btest uses medoid of clusters as a representative to test the relation between clusters. A user can use other options using ``-d`` with other decomposition methods such as PCA, ICA, MCA. For example, ``-d pca`` will use the first principal component of a cluster as its representative.   

### Pairwise association testsing or AllA ###

A user can choose AllA as a naive pairwise testing approach using ``-a pair`` option in the command line where the default is ``-a block`` which uses the hierarchical approach.

### Filtering features from input by minimum entropy ###

btest by default removes features with low entropy (<.5) to reduce the unnecessary number tests. A user can use different threshold using option ``-e $THRESHOLD``. $THRESHOLD by default is .5.

## Tools ##

### datasim: a tool for synthetic data ###
datasim generates paired datasets with various properties including: the size (number of features (rows) and samples (columns)),  the number of blocks (clusters within each dataset, the structure of clusters, the type of associations between features,  distribution of data (normal and uniform), the structure of clustering with each dataset,  the strongness of association between cluster among datasets define by noise between associated blocks, and the strongness of similarity between features within clusters defined by noise within blocks.

Here are two examples to generate paired datasets with the associations between them and btest runs. 

`datasim -f 32 -n 100 -a line -d uniform -s balanced -o btest`

The outputs will be located in `btest_data_f32_s100_line` directory and include a paired datasets: `X_line_32_100.txt`    `Y_line_32_100.txt` and `A_line_32_100.txt` association between them. A's rows are features in X dataset, and A's columns are features in Y dataset and for each cell in A zero means no significant association and 1 mean significant association. 
To run btest use on this synthetic data use:

`btest -X btest/X_line_32_100.txt -Y btest/Y_line_32_100.txt -o btest_output_f32_n100_line_spearman`
As all features in datasets are continuous btest uses Spearman coefficient as the similarity metric. One can specify a different similarity metric.  For example, try the same dataset with Normalized Mutual Information:
`btest -X btest/X_line_32_100.txt -Y btest/Y_line_32_100.txt -o btest_output_f32_n100_line_nmi -m nmi`

For mixed data (categorical, continuous data) btest automatically uses NMI as simialrity metric.
Let's generate some mixed data:

`datasim -f 32 -n 100 -a mixed -d uniform -s balanced -o btest_data_f32_n100_mixed`

Run btest od the data:

`btest -X btest_data_f32_n100_mixed/X_mixed_32_100.txt -Y btest_data_f32_n100_mixed/Y_mixed_32_100.txt -o btest_output_f32_n100_mixed`

If you try mixed data, btest provides a warning and ends as Spearman does NOT work with noncontinuous data. 

```
usage: datasim [-h] [-v] [-f FEATURES] [-n SAMPLES] [-a ASSOCIATION]
                 [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-b NOISE_BETWEEN] [-w NOISE_WITHIN] -o
                 OUTPUT [-s STRUCTURE]

### btest Python API ###
btest function along with command line can be called from other programs using Python API we provide an example is demonstrated here to show how to import and use `btesttest` function :

```
#!python

from btest.btest import btesttest

def main():
    btest(X='/path/to/first/datase/X.txt',\
               Y= '/path/to/second/datase/Y.txt',\
               output_dir='/path/to/btest/output/btest_output_demo')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main( )  
```



### Nonparametric p-value ###
We have implemented both empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) and fast and accurate approach, generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) by Knijnenburg et al. 2009, permutation test. The function can be imported to other python programs :

```
#!python

from btest.stats import permutation_test_pvalue 
import numpy as np

def main():
    
    # Generate a list of random values for first vector
    np.random.seed(0)
    x_rand = np.random.rand(1,10)[0]   
    
    # Generate a list of random values for second vector
    # set the numpy seed for different random values from the first set
    np.random.seed(1)
    y_rand = np.random.rand(1, 10)[0]
    
    # Calculate pvalue using empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
    p_random_ecdf = permutation_test_pvalue(X  = x_rand, Y = y_rand, similarity_method = 'spearman',permutation_func = 'ecdf')
    p_perfect_ecdf = permutation_test_pvalue(X  = x_rand, Y = x_rand, similarity_method = 'spearman', permutation_func = 'ecdf')
    print ("ECDF P-value for random data: %s, ECDF P-value for perfect correlation data: %s")%(p_random_ecdf, p_perfect_ecdf)
    
    # Calculate pvalue using our implementation in btest for generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) approach proposed by Knijnenburg et al. 2009 
    p_random_gpd = permutation_test_pvalue(X  = x_rand, Y = y_rand, similarity_method = 'spearman',permutation_func = 'gpd')
    p_perfect_gpd = permutation_test_pvalue(X  = x_rand, Y = x_rand, similarity_method = 'spearman', permutation_func = 'gpd')
    print ("GPD P-value for random data: %s, GPD P-value for perfect correlation data: %s")%(p_random_gpd, p_perfect_gpd)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main( ) 
```
The parameters that can be provided to the permutation test for calculating p-value are:

* `iterations`: the number permutation for the test (i.e. 1000)
* `permutation_func` can be either 'ECDF' or 'GPD'
* `similarity_method` a similarity metric supported by btest (check what are the choices by 'btest -h')
* `seed` if -1 each run seeds a random value, 0 uses the same seed any place does permutation.
